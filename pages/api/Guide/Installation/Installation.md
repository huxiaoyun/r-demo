## Installation

### NPM

NPM is the easiest and fastest way to get started using Viser. It is also the recommended installation method when building single-page applications (SPAs). It pairs nicely with a CommonJS module bundler such as Webpack.

```bash
# latest stable
$ npm install viser
```

### UMD

The UMD build is also available on unpkg.com  ( unpkg )   :

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/viser/umd/Viser.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on window.Viser


### Dev Build

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/viser/viser.git
$ cd viser
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
